        In the National Capital Region (NCR), particularly in Delhi, the key difference in property registration lies in the 
        stamp duty calculation based on gender, where male buyers typically pay a higher stamp duty rate (6%) compared to female
        buyers (4%) for the same property value; additionally, the "Anywhere Registration" policy allows residents to register
        their property at any sub-registrar office within Delhi, regardless of their location
        
        key points about property registration in NCR:
          1. Gender-based stamp duty:
            The primary distinction is the different stamp duty rates based on the buyer's gender, 
            with females generally receiving a lower rate. 
          2. Registration fee:
            A standard registration fee of 1% of the property value is typically applied. 
          3. "Anywhere Registration":
            Delhi residents can now register their property at any sub-registrar office within the city, 
            providing flexibility in choosing a convenient location

  utter_charges:

        The registration charges for the property are as follows:
      
        1. Up to 4 years: 2% of average annual rent + ₹100 (security deposit).
        2. 5-10 years: 5% of average annual rent; 10-20 years: 5% of double average annual rent.
        Registration charges: ₹1100 (via Demand Draft).

    - text: |
        There are major 3 types rental Agreement in NCR:

        1. 11-Month Rental: Tenant pays monthly rent, electricity, water, and maintenance charges; renewable after 11 months.
        2. Long-Term Lease: No monthly rent; tenant pays a lump sum lease amount (refunded later). Tenant covers electricity, 
           water, and maintenance charges; no interest on the lease amount.
        3. Commercial Lease: Registration and Stamp Duty processes are the same as for residential rentals.

  utter_consequences:
    - text: |
        There are some Consequences of not having proper registration of the property:
        
        1. Consequences of Not Paying Stamp Duty:
        Using low-value Stamp paper to save costs can result in heavy fines. 
        For example, Ashok rents his house to Mahesh on a Rs. 50 Stamp paper. 
        When Mahesh stops paying rent, Ashok faces a Rs. 18,600 fine for underpaid Stamp Duty, 
        instead of the proper Rs. 1860.

        2. Consequences of Not Registering the Agreement:
        An unregistered agreement holds no legal weight in court. 
        For instance, Amit’s rental agreement with Vikas was stamped but not registered. 
        When Vikas disputes the rent, the court rejects the unregistered document, and 
        Amit loses the case due to lack of evidence.

        Delhi has dropped the conventional stamp paper systems and shifted entirely to the e-Stamping system operated by 
        Stock Holding Corporation of India (SHCIL). If a person needs Stamp paper he can approach the e-Stamping vendors 
        and purchase it from them. You need to provide your name and the purpose in the application form. The conventional 
        Stamp papers are no longer used in Delhi.
